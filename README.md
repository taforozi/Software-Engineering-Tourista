# Software-Engineering-Tourista
This group assignment is part of the course _Software Engineering_ (8th Semester) and its main objective is to specify the User and System requirements and develop the User Stories in Gherkin language. Additionally, using the SwaggerHub platform, we implement these requirements based on REST-API standards. We also recognize the system resources and we build the REST services through flows using the Node-RED (flow editor).\
Me and my team decided to develop the **Tourista App**, a web application that can be used by a traveller. Based on the user's preferences, the system is able to propose a complete program and make his/hers journey enjoyable!
