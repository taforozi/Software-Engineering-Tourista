# Software-Engineering-Tourista
This group assignment is part of the course _Software Engineering_ (8th Semester) and its main objective is to specify the User and System requirements and develop the User Stories in Gherkin language. Additionally, using the SwaggerHub platform, we implement these requirements based on REST-API standards. We also recognize the system resources and we build the REST services through flows using the Node-RED (flow editor).\
Me and my team decided to develop the **Tourista App**, a web application that can be used by a traveller. Based on the user's preferences, the system is able to propose a complete program and make their journey enjoyable!

## User/System Requirements
The Functional and Non-Functional Requirements of the application can be found in [Tourista_FunctionalRequirements.txt](Tourista_FunctionalRequirements.txt) and [Tourista_NonFunctionalRequirements.txt](Tourista_NonFunctionalRequirements.txt) files respectively.

## GUI
This folder contains the Graphical User Interface mockups of Tourista App that we created on Figma platform.

## User Stories
This folder contains 10 user stories in Gherkin language, in order to provide the necessary information about the app's functionality.

## Swagger API
The API of Tourista is available on Swaggerhub platform, [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/ThomiSEAuth/Tourista-API/1.0.0#free), and the API documentation can be found [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/ThomiSEAuth/Tourista-API/1.0.0).\
Additionally, three files are mentioned as follows: 

* **python-flask-server-generated.zip**: Server Stub file as it is generated from SwaggerHub in Python
* **swagger-client-generated.zip**: Client SDK file as it is generated from SwaggerHub in Python
* **tourista-api-swagger.json**: Tourista API in .json format

## Node-RED
Node-RED flows of the application can be found in [tourista-flows.json](tourista-flows.json) file. You can download it as a json file and drag-and-drop it in Node-RED platform to see our job.
